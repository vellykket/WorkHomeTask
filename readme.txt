Hello!
My name is Vladislav Stadnik and this is my test task.
In order to run it on your device, you need docker and docker-compose.
Upload the project wherever you want. Then open the console and enter the following commands:

docker-compose build
docker-compose up

You can also connect to the database via IDE.
You will need the following data:
USER -> SA
PASSWORD -> Password2020
HOST -> localhost
PORT -> 1433
DATABASE -> HomeTask

To stop running containers, enter

docker-compose stop
